#### Predict affinity between misconceptions and incorrect answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions

In this competition, you’ll develop an NLP model driven by ML to accurately predict the affinity between misconceptions and incorrect answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions. This solution will suggest candidate misconceptions for distractors, making it easier for expert human teachers to tag distractors with misconceptions.
